# Dynamic-Branch-Predictor
As opposed to traditional Branch Prediction techniques, when machine learning techniques are introduced in branch prediction, we tend to get relatively better prediction accuracy. This increase is because of introduction of perceptrons in branch prediction algorithm.

The Perceptron Branch predictor is compared to existing branch prediction techniques like Gshare, Two-level, Hybrid (Perceptron + Gshare) branch predictors against numerous benchmarks.
